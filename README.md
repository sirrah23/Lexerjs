Hello and welcome to Lexerjs. This is a simple lexical analyzer that written in node.js after following along
with this excellent [blog post](http://blog.felixangell.com/implementing-a-programming-language-in-d-part-1/) by Felix Angell.

The language that gets lexed is called Elba. It is a simple language made up by Felix for the sake of the exercise.
